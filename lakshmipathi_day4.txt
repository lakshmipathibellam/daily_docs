--> DevOps.
It is culture which varies from organization to organization (or) it is the process of delivery by ensuring by the automation(CI/CD) in place, ensuring the quality by continuous monitoring & testing.

--> Why Do We Need DevOps.

1. To deliver the s/w or project or product on time.
2. To deliver the product with high quality(accurately).
3. To deliver by automation -CI/CD tools.
4. To deliver by continuous monitoring & testing.
5. In order to upgrade its version.
6. Enhances communication between development and operations teams.

--> Key Components of DevOps.

1. CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)
Continuous Integration (CI): Developers frequently merge code into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests are run.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Code changes pass through automated tests and are deployed to production environments without manual intervention.

2. DevOps Teams and Responsibilities

 Development Team (Dev)
 Planning – Understanding business requirements.
 Coding – Writing and developing software.
 Building – Compiling and packaging code.
 Testing (Internal) – Performing unit and integration tests.

 Operations Team (Ops)
 Deployment – Releasing software to production.
 Monitoring – Tracking system health and performance.
 Automation – Reducing manual efforts through tools like Ansible, Terraform, etc.

--> Python:
A high-level, versatile programming language used for automation, scripting, web development, and data science. It supports both procedural and 
object-oriented programming.

--> MySQL
An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage structured data efficiently, widely used in web applications.

--> Git
A version control system (VCS) that tracks code changes, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently using repositories like GitHub and GitLab.

--> Linux
An open-source operating system widely used in servers, cloud environments, and DevOps for its stability, security, and command-line utilities.

-->Jenkins
A widely used CI/CD automation tool that enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications automatically.

-->Docker
A containerization tool that packages applications with dependencies into lightweight, portable containers for efficient deployment.

--> Maven
A build automation tool for Java projects that manages dependencies and builds project artifacts using XML-based configuration files (POM.xml).

--> Tomcat
An open-source web server and servlet container that runs Java applications and supports Java Server Pages (JSP) and Servlets.

--> Kubernetes
A container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

--> SonarQube
It is a Continuous code quality and security analysis tool.

--> Ansible
It is a Open-source automation tool for configuration management and application deployment.
