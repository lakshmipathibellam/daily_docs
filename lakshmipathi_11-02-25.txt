1. cloud:processes the data & uses the application.
---> install linux,windows,jenkins,mysql,git
cloud computing:It is an ability (or) place where we can store our data.
-->we can access/ process the data from anywhere in the world.
-->we can access the data only when we have the interner connection.
-->there are 2 different types of cloud computing:

	1. service model-->saas,Paas,Iaas,Faas

Iaas: Infrastructure as a service
-->provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
-->no worries about handling the internal machines.
Ex: whole infrastructure will be given to us, we will create our own applications and use it.

-->Data---Application---Run-Time---Middleware---OS--->will be managed by ourselves(DevOps Engineer)
--->Virtualization---Servers---Storage---Networking---> will be managed by our vendors(clients).

Paas: Platform as a service
--->only data & application will be maintained by ourselves.
---> remaining all(Runtime--middleware--os--virtualization--servers--storage--networking) will be maintained by vendors.
Ex: Google 
----> we can create our own applications.

Saas: software as a service

--> only data will be maintained by ourselves.
--> remaining all will be maintained by vendors).

	2. deployment model-->1. private cloud
			     2. public cloud
			     3. hybrid cloud
			     4. community cloud
				eg: A(start up)---->IBM---->ABC(cloud)

AWS:Amazon web service
---> top/best most cloud provider.
--->first cloud which is introduced in the market.
--->Saas&Paas---->combination
---> without any physical space this aws allows people to store the data.
--->"pay as you go"
--->18 geographical regions-aws is covering
--->started 2005.
Devops:
DEv+Ops--->its an combination of developer team & operational team.
-->it is the way of s/w developemnt.
-->it is a methodolgy.
-->it is a set of tools.
-->it is the way to automate things.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Devops:
devops is the "process of delivering the product/project by ensuring automation in place ,ensuring the quality with continous monitoring & continous testing".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
why devops:
1. to deliver the s/w (or) project(or) product on time.
phonepe app----v1---->v2----10days(without devops)
			----2days(with devops)
----> devops uses CI/CD(continous integration/continous deployment).
----------------------------------------------------
SDLC:software development life cycle
1.waterfall model:also called as "linear sequential development model"(non-iterative)
		Requirement analysis---->System design--->Implementation---->Deployment---->Maintenance.

----SRS-s/w requirement specification.
-->it takes 6 months -12 months(1 year) to develop a s/w using this model.
1. requirement analysis: SRC document
2. system design:design-plannig-assigning works/tasks to the teams.
			Low level & high level----(first phase)
	coding will be done with implementation(second phase)
3. Implementation:
-->integrates all the coding done in the previous step.
--> starts testing.
4. Deployment:
--> complete s/w will be moved/shifted to the global server from local server.
5. Maintenance:
-->Monitoring the s/w or application.


2.agile model:
--> s/w shopping amazon,flipkart,myntra,ajio social media fb,twitter,instagram,watsapp.
-->agile- means "the ability to respond to the changes from requirements, technology & people".
--> incremental & iterative to develope a s/w (or) application.		
-->v1---->v2-----V3----release.
-->we will deliver a piece of s/w with few functionality.

3 Principles of Agile:
1. customer no need to wait till the whole s/w is developed.
2. delivering the piece of s/w which contains some functionalities which is already developed & tested.
3.we can accomodate/accept the requirement changes from the customers continously.

Advantages:
1. requirement changes are allowed at any stage of development.
2. releases will be too fast-->1 week
3. customers no need of waiting for longer time.
4.good communication will be there between all the teams.
5. it is very easy to adopt.

Disadvantage:
1. less focus on design & documentation.

Agile s/w developement process:

Requirement analysis--->System design-->development-->testing--->deployment---->Review---->delivery--->feedback---->system design

Agile process involves 3 segments:

Agile scrum process:
Scrum master(team lead) --> ensure that the team is working properly or not--> motivating.
grooming calls ---> requirements of the applications will be diovided into epics(huge requirements).----->epics will divide equally to all the team members.
Daily scrum---daily updates(reg any issues?/chanllenges?/any blocker?)

1. sprint meeting:meeting regarding the process of agile & duration
2. sprint review:review the planning to develop a s/w.
3. sprint retrospective:calls-->Dev call---> QA call-->optional meeting.

Topics for exam on friday(27/12/2024):
1. Devops-Intoduction
2. Maunal testing concepts
3. SDLC: waterfall & Agile methodologies
4. cloud, cloud computing

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
testing:manual testing-->3 types
1. white box:
--->developers will test each & every line of code.
-->need programming skills to design test cases.
-->developers fixes bugs & performs 1 round of WB testing--send it to the testing team.
---> fixing bugs clearing the errors-->deleting the bugs.
2. Black box testing:
--> examine the functionality of the s/w.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
bugs:developer----operations team(testing--finds any error)
error-mistakes in coding done by the developer.
deffect:error accepted by the developer.
failure: total wrong.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
V-model
spiral model
prototype
incremental
--------------------------------
tools required:
1. planning/coding/SCM:git,jira
2. building code:Maven,gradle,apache ANT
3. testing:selenium testing with python
4. integration: Jenkins(CI/CD)
5. deployment:Dockers,Kubernates
6. operations:Ansible--(managing)
7. monitoring:teraform
-----------------------------------------

2. black box--->2 types-->functional & non-functional; functional-->3 types-->unit ,integration & system
3. grey box
