DAY – 3
 What are the cloud computing types?
 Cloud computing is generally categorized into three main types based on service models and
four main types based on deployment models.
 There are two types of :
1. Service model.
2. Deployment Model.
 Types Based on Service Models.
1. Iaas: Infrastructure as a service
2. Paas : Platform as a service
3. Saas: Software as a service.
 Mainly in a company’s it requerements
Data,Networking,Storage,Servers,Virtualization,Operating system,Middleware,Runtime are
very crucial
 Iaas : Infrastructure as a software?
 It providing the virtualized computing resources over the internet.
 No worry about the underlying physical machines.
 Iaas is leads to develop your applications. Cloud allow only virtualized infrastructure can rent
and develop a new application.
 In this model the vender will take care of networking, Storage, Servers, Virtualization.
 Reaming servers like Data, Application, Middleware, Runtime and OS (Operating system) are
will be taker of ourselves.
 Paas : Platform as a software?
 Platform as a service that have any control over the underlying architecture.
 We can create our own applications and keep it on Google app engine
 Paas is leads to develop your IT SYSTEM with help of cloud.
 In paas cloud offers the rent the platform to developers or organizations.
 In this model the vendor will take care Middleware, Networking, Storage, Servers,
Virtualization, Runtime, Os
 Reaming like Data, Application will be take care of ourselves.
 Ex : Google search engine
 Saas : software as a service?
 Saas is a combination of Iaas + Paas.
 It provides a full application stack as a server that customer can access it & also use it.
 The application that are run in a cloud infrastructure is known as ‘’Saas”.
 In this model all the services like Data, application, Middleware, Runtime, Storage, Servers,
virtualization will be take care of vender.
 Ex: Food delivery app
